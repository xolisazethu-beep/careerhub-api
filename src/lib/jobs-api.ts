/**
 * Server-side job data layer for the App Router routes (Assignment 2.1).
 *
 * Every consumer here is a Server Component, so these helpers run on the server
 * only — the data is fetched before the HTML is sent and NEVER refetched in the
 * browser. The fetch itself lives in each page (so `cache: "no-store"` is visible
 * at the call site, as the assignment requires); this module owns the base URL
 * and the wire→view adapters so the three routes stay in sync.
 *
 * NOTE ON THE BASE URL: this project established two public env vars in 1.4.
 *   • NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL → the REAL ASP.NET + Postgres backend (job reads
 *     and now job writes). This is what the new Server Components read.
 *   • NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL      → reserved for the in-app, same-origin mock routes
 *     (application submit, recruiter applicant review). Left UNSET on purpose so
 *     those calls stay same-origin.
 * The assignment text writes `${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/jobs`; here that role is
 * played by NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL because a Server Component fetch needs an
 * ABSOLUTE url and this project already names the real backend that way.

 * A bare `fetch` that throws on the first hiccup crashes the whole page. So this:
 *   • allows a generous per-attempt timeout (a slow-but-valid cold response still
 *     succeeds rather than being aborted), and
 *   • retries on network errors and 5xx with a short backoff (the backend is warm
 *     by the 2nd/3rd try).
 * It deliberately does NOT retry 4xx (a 404 must reach the page so it can call
 * `notFound()`); it still keeps `cache: "no-store"`; and it still throws once the
 * retries are exhausted, so the route's error boundary takes over gracefully.

 * runs the underlying fetch exactly ONCE and hands the memoised result to the

 *   • both call sites import THIS SAME `getJob` (not a re-implemented fetch), and
 *   • they pass the IDENTICAL `id` string, within the same request lifecycle.
 * (Next also layers its own Data Cache on the `force-cache` fetch below, but the
 * `cache()` wrapper is what collapses the two calls inside one render.)
 *
 * Returns `null` for a genuine 404 so callers can branch (page → notFound(),
 * generateMetadata → { title: "Job Not Found" }); throws on any other failure so
